This is more than your standard payment gateway, though. Payments is just one of the great apps in Marketing 360.

3. Add fields for capturing user information and be sure to set them as required. You must include the following from the Advanced Fields group:
	a. Name field
	b. Email field

	a. At least one Product field
	b. Mkt 360® Card field

These are entirely up to you and are determined by the kind of information you need to collect from a customer at the time of their payment.
